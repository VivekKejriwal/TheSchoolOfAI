Shows a Neural network using Pytorch framework that has:

1. 6 Convolution layers with these kernels (10, 10, 20, 20, 30)

2. uses 2 max-pooling layers

3. Global Average Pooling layer is used, which is accompanied by a Fully connected final layer

4. uses EMNIST(handwritten alphabets) as the dataset having 26 distinguishable classes

5. Uses Mini-Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent.
